                <h1>Project Boron: Exploring Uses and Expanding Novel Boron Compounds</h1>
                <p class="indented">
                In 2003, the first pharmaceutical drug with boron was approved, since then only five boron compounds have been approved for anti-cancer- and other uses. Compared to other new pharmaceutical compounds the usage of boron in these medicines continues to lag behind other elements. However, this doesnâ€™t reflect actual interest, over the past 20 years research on boron-based drugs has been increasing. The developing interest in boron-based drugs was primarily due to the common belief that boron is toxic, due to its presence in ant-poison. This has since been falsified, as the lethal dose (LD50) of the main ingredient boric acid was 2660 mg/kg when administered orally to rats. When compared to the LD50 of table salt at 3000 mg/kg, the difference is quite small, whereas boric acid is only around 12% more lethal.

                There are many unresearched boron compounds and our team aims to contribute to this growing body of work. We aim to add to the boron toolkit and explore the usage of novel boron compounds for antifungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer applications. Our further research on boron-based compounds can also be used to enhance the development and training of software used in computational studies (i.e molecular docking and other preliminary drug discovery software). We finally want to elucidate 3 main research questions:
                </p>

                <p> 
                1. What makes B chemistry and compounds different?
                </p>

                <p>
                 2. Why are there so few B drugs?
                </p>

                <p>
                 3. When/How does B conformation change with target engagement?
                 </p>
